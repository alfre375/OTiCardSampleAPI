#How to set up the sample API (Directly)
1) Open the terminal to the directory BEFORE the API. GITHUB WILL MAKE A NEW DIRECTORY!
2) Type the command "git clone git@github.com:alfre375/OTiCardSampleAPI.git" into the terminal
3) Open the .env file
4) Go to [xclamate.com:7879/genSellerKey](xclamate.com:7879/genSellerKey) while logged in to generate a seller key. WARNING! DO NOT OBTAIN IT THIS WAY IF YOU ALREADY GENERATED ONE!
5) Return to the .env file and put the seller key after the OTICARDKEY=
6) (Optional) Set the IP and PORT (domains allowed for IP), NOTE! Seller keys vary from server to server!
7) Save the .env file. NEVER EVER SHARE YOUR SELLER KEY WITH **ANYBODY**!
